# PC Exercises from Numerical Solution of Stochastic Differential Equations, by Kloeden and Platen

This is my attempt to, in the long term, solve all the PC Exercises in the fantastic monograph by Kloeden and Platen using *Python*.

Bear in mind that I am mostly interested in the exercises from **Part IV: Time Discrete Approximations** and **Part V: Strong Approximations**, so I might not necessarily go in order, but I will try.

Wish me luck.

Here is the list of exercises.

## Part I. Preliminaries

### Chapter 1: Probability and Statistics

- [ ] PC-Exercise 1.3.1
- [X] PC-Exercise 1.4.4

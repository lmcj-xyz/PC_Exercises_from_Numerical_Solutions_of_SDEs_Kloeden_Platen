# PC Exercises from Numerical Solution of Stochastic Differential Equations, by Kloeden and Platen

This is my attempt to, in the *veeeeeeery* long term, solve all the PC Exercises in the fantastic monograph by Kloeden and Platen using *Python*.

Bear in mind that I am mostly interested in the exercises from **Part IV: Time Discrete Approximations** and **Part V: Strong Approximations**, so I might not necessarily go in the order of the book, but I will try.

Also, since most of things in probability require many repetitions to be representative, and therefore we need arrays of potentially many dimensions, the code here will be done using *NumPy* and *SciPy* to handle arrays and perform operations over them.

For visualization it will be used *Matplotlib*.

Wish me luck.

Here is the list of exercises.

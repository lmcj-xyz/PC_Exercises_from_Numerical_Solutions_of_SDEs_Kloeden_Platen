@title: PC-Exercise 8.1.3

Looking at the results in the book it seems you do not have to truncate anymore,
so I removed that, even though it clearly says that you must follow 
PC-Exercise 8.1.2.

So, since it asks you to compare with the Euler method from previous Exercise,
I include that here without the truncation. This is the second figure produced,
while the first one is the one that appears in the book.
